        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8">Why Daily Typing Practice Matters</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
          Just like learning a musical instrument or mastering a sport, typing requires muscle memory and consistency. By practicing daily, you train your fingers to find the keys automatically, leading to faster and more accurate typing. Here is why it is essential:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
          <li><strong>Reinforces Muscle Memory</strong>: Daily practice helps your fingers remember the key positions, improving your accuracy and speed over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Builds Speed Gradually</strong>: Regular typing sessions increase your Words Per Minute (WPM) steadily as your confidence grows.</li>
          <li><strong>Improves Focus</strong>: Consistent practice improves your ability to focus on the content you are typing, rather than searching for keys.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduces Errors</strong>: Typing daily allows you to spot and correct mistakes quickly, ensuring fewer errors in your work.</li>
        </ul>
